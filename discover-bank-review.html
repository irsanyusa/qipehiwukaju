But did you also know that you can earn high interest, and even cash back rewards, on deposit accounts at Discover® Bank?</p><p>Discover® Bank doesn’t pay the highest rates on any particular account. But what sets this bank apart is that it pays high interest on all its savings accounts and on most certificates of deposit (CDs). In addition, the bank charges very few fees. And if that isn’t enough, checking and savings accounts have no minimum deposit or balance requirements.</p><p>That’s why Discover® Bank is worth investigating for anyone looking for a new place to bank.</p><h2 id=who-is-discover-bank-for>Who is Discover® Bank for?</h2><p>Discover® Bank is a good choice for anyone who is looking to earn higher interest on deposit accounts than what is typically offered at brick-and-mortar banks. Discover pays above-average interest on nearly all account types. But where it shines most is with its online savings account, which pays high interest on all account balances, and its CDs.</p><p>Discover® Bank also has an excellent checking account, offering cash back rewards on purchases made with the debit card. The account doesn’t pay interest, but there are no fees or minimum-balance requirements.</p><p>In addition, Discover® offers some of the best credit cards in the industry. If you have one of those cards, Discover® Bank can be a natural choice to open a savings account to earn high interest or a checking account with cash back rewards.</p><h2 id=review-of-discover-products>Review of Discover® products</h2><p>Here’s a closer look at the products Discover® offers.</p><h3>Discover® Checking Account</h3><h3 class=product-title>Discover® Checking Account</h3><p>APY*</p><p>1% in cash back on up to $3,000 in debit card purchases each month</p><p>Min. deposit</p><p>$0</p><p>Monthly fee</p><p>$0</p><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Pros & cons:</h3></p><h3 class=title>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Earn 1% cash back rewards on debit card purchases.</li><li>No minimum initial deposit or account-balance requirements.</li><li>No monthly service fees, NSF fees, or overdraft fees.</li><li>Paper checks available on request.</li></ul><h3 class=title>Cons:</h3><ul><li>No branch locations.</li><li>Account is not interest-bearing.</li></ul><p>The Discover® Checking Account comes with the Discover It® Cash Back debit card, which pays 1% in cash back on up to $3,000 in debit card purchases each month.That adds up to $30 each month, or as much as $360 per year.</p><p>The account requires no minimum initial deposit and no ongoing minimum balance.

At the time, Discover was part of Sears, Roebuck, and Co., and the card itself was launched nationally by the Dean Witter Financial Services Group subsidiary in 1986.</p><p>In 1993, Dean Witter spun off from Sears, under an independent, publicly traded company, Dean Witter, Discover & Co. Discover Financial Services came into existence in February 1999 and, in 2006, Discover was spun off to become the independent, publicly traded company it is today, operating as Discover Financial Services.</p><p>The company enjoys a Better Business Bureau rating of A+, the agency’s highest rating.
