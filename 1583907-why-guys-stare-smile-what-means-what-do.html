Your hair, outfit, or presence could draw their attention.</p><p class=align-left>However, for most ladies, the lack of a smile adds mystery to the situation.

Chances are he is having a bad day or in an emotional tailspin. A guy can experience a tough day or even a series of them. A stressed mind can get him distracted or make him daydream.</p><p class=align-left>While it's easy to interpret his gaze as directed towards you, consider that he might be lost in thought about his problems while unintentionally looking in your direction. That doesn't necessarily reflect anything personal.

He probably fancies your company but perceives you as out of his league. Your poised demeanour, confidence, and boldness make him insecure about approaching you. His shyness overwhelms his sense of assurance, and the idea of approaching you makes him anxious.</p><p class=align-left>Some guys feel intimidated by women they find attractive, and their natural response might be to stare but not smile. If you sense that he's intimidated by you, consider initiating a conversation with him instead.
