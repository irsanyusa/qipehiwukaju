Among the Masai of eastern Africa, the North American Plains Indians and dozens of other pretechnological peoples, a man could not marry until he had demonstrated his capacity to kill in battle. Leadership too in a warrior culture is typically contingent on military prowess and wrapped in the mystique of death. In the Solomon Islands a chief’s importance could be reckoned by the number of skulls posted around his door, and it was the duty of the Aztec kings to nourish the gods with the hearts of human captives.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All warrior peoples have fought for the same high-sounding reasons: honor, glory or revenge. The nature of their real and perhaps not conscious motivations is a subject of much debate. Some anthropologists postulate a ) murderous instinct, almost unique among living species, in human males. Others discern a materialistic motive behind every fray: a need for slaves, grazing land or even human flesh to eat. Still others point to the similarities between war and other male pastimes — the hunt and outdoor sports — and suggest that it is boredom, ultimately, that stirs men to fight.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But in a warrior culture it hardly matters which motive is most basic. Aggressive behavior is rewarded whether or not it is innate to the human psyche. Shortages of resources are habitually taken as occasions for armed offensives, rather than for hard thought and innovation. And war, to a warrior people, is of course the highest adventure, the surest antidote to malaise, the endlessly repeated theme of legend, song, religious myth and personal quest for meaning. It is how men die and what they find to live for.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You must understand that Americans are a warrior nation,” Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan told a group of Arab leaders in early September, one month into the Middle East crisis. He said this proudly, and he may, without thinking through the ugly implications, have told the truth. In many ways, in outlook and behavior the U.S. has begun to act like a primitive warrior culture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We seem to believe that leadership is expressed, in no small part, by a willingness to cause the deaths of others. After the U.S. invasion of Panama, President Bush exulted that no one could call him “timid”; he was at last a “macho man.” The press, in even more primal language, hailed him for succeeding in an “initiation rite” by demonstrating his “willingness to shed blood.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For lesser offices too we apply the standards of a warrior culture. Female candidates are routinely advised to overcome the handicap of their gender by talking “tough.” Thus, for example, Dianne Feinstein has embraced capital punishment, while Colorado senatorial candidate Josie Heath has found it necessary to announce that although she is the mother of an 18-year-old son, she is prepared to vote for war. Male candidates in some of the fall contests are finding their military records under scrutiny. No one expects them, as elected officials in a civilian government, to pick up a spear or a sling and fight. But they must state, at least, their willingness to have another human killed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More tellingly, we are unnerved by peace and seem to find it boring. When the cold war ended, we found no reason to celebrate. Instead we heated up the “war on drugs.” What should have been a public-health campaign, focused on the persistent shame of poverty, became a new occasion for martial rhetoric and muscle flexing. Months later, when the Berlin Wall fell and communism collapsed throughout Europe, we Americans did not dance in the streets. What we did, according to the networks, was change the channel to avoid the news. Nonviolent revolutions do not uplift us, and the loss of mortal enemies only seems to leave us empty and bereft.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Our collective fantasies center on mayhem, cruelty and violent death. Loving images of the human body — especially of bodies seeking pleasure or expressing love — inspire us with the urge to censor. Our preference is for warrior themes: the lone fighting man, bandoliers across his naked chest, mowing down lesser men in gusts of automatic-weapon fire. Only a real war seems to revive our interest in real events. With the Iraqi crisis, the networks report, ratings for news shows rose again — even higher than they were for Panama.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And as in any primitive warrior culture, our warrior elite takes pride of place. Social crises multiply numbingly — homelessness, illiteracy, epidemic disease — and our leaders tell us solemnly that nothing can be done. There is no money. We are poor, not rich, a debtor nation. Meanwhile, nearly a third of the federal budget flows, even in moments of peace, to the warriors and their weaponmakers. When those priorities are questioned, some new “crisis” dutifully arises to serve as another occasion for armed and often unilateral intervention.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, with Operation Desert Shield, our leaders are reduced to begging foreign powers for the means to support our warrior class. It does not seem to occur to us that the other great northern powers — Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union — might not have found the stakes so high or the crisis quite so threatening. It has not penetrated our imagination that in a world where the powerful, industrialized nation-states are at last at peace, there might be other ways to face down a pint-size Third World warrior state than with massive force of arms. Nor have we begun to see what an anachronism we are in danger of becoming: a warrior nation in a world that pines for peace, a high- tech state with the values of a warrior band.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A leftist might blame “imperialism”; a right-winger would call our problem “internationalism.” But an anthropologist, taking the long view, might | say this is just what warriors do. Intoxicated by their own drumbeats and war songs, fascinated by the glint of steel and the prospect of blood, they will go forth, time and again, to war.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9uam5haYNwsdKsmLJlpJ2ybsPAq6mip6JisLa4066pnmc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1605248-breaking-pandemonium-female-reps-member-kidnapped-church-service.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gunshots as Ex-Reps Member Kidnapped Inside Church in Delta</a>
