You have DEFINITELY heard about the Great Pyramids in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a>. But what if&nbsp;I told you that Tesla may have probably uncovered the ancient mystery surrounding the pyramids?</p><p>Wait, what? Is&nbsp;this a&nbsp;crossover episode? Nope! It’s highly probable that the secrets of&nbsp;the pyramids are hidden in&nbsp;plain sight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/88f/18d/91ae63538191494f5e779a9402.png><p>But first let’s recap what we&nbsp;know about the Pyramids. What’s so&nbsp;mysterious about them? I&nbsp;mean, they are just old quirky buildings, aren’t they? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>One of&nbsp;the biggest questions is&nbsp;how they were built</u></a>.</p><p>Some people think that the pyramids were created by&nbsp;people using only their hands and muscles, but others think that there might have been some kind of&nbsp;crazy energy source that we&nbsp;don’t know about yet. Like, what if&nbsp;aliens helped out or&nbsp;something? Just kidding!</p><p>But this idea of&nbsp;some unknown energy source being used to&nbsp;build the pyramids has been around for ages. Even in&nbsp;old texts, like the Pyramid Texts, it&nbsp;talks about how “The gods gave&nbsp;us something to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;great power.” So&nbsp;maybe there was something really powerful and mysterious going on&nbsp;back then. Who knows?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/90d/50e/13fccf5ca6a77c8277a9b35433.png><p>Back in&nbsp;the early 1900s, he&nbsp;got obsessed with the Great Pyramids of&nbsp;Egypt. He&nbsp;read numerous books about these ancient structures and was blown away by&nbsp;how much energy they seemed to&nbsp;have.</p><p>At&nbsp;that time, not many people knew much about electricity, and Tesla started to&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;there was some kind of&nbsp;advanced tech hidden in&nbsp;the pyramids. He&nbsp;had an&nbsp;idea that the power of&nbsp;the pyramids had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with electromagnetism, and he&nbsp;put a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time and effort into trying to&nbsp;figure out the mystery.</p><p>Tesla had some pretty unusual theories about the Great Pyramids. He&nbsp;thought that they could actually store and move electricity, which could then be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;power up&nbsp;the areas around them. He&nbsp;also had this theory that the pyramids were built using some kind of&nbsp;crystal energy. He&nbsp;believed that the chambers inside the pyramids could have these super-powerful crystals that could control the electromagnetic fields.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/094/2ae/d14ab55911b1549297a604ba9c.png><p>But that’s not all. Tesla also had this idea that the materials used to&nbsp;make the pyramids had properties that allowed them to&nbsp;trap energy from the <a href=# title=sun data-link=tag>sun</a> and the <a href=# title=moon data-link=tag>moon</a>. And not just a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;energy. He&nbsp;thought that the pyramid could actually create this massive energy field that could light up&nbsp;whole cities or&nbsp;even brighten up&nbsp;dark places.</p><p>He&nbsp;thought that the pyramids could be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;giant power plants to&nbsp;generate electricity and run machines. Tesla even believed that the pyramids were somehow linked to&nbsp;cosmic energy, which could be&nbsp;used for spiritual enlightenment and healing. How very New Age of&nbsp;him!</p><p>Anyway, Tesla wasn’t just pulling these ideas out of&nbsp;thin air. He&nbsp;was seriously into studying everything he&nbsp;could about the pyramids, from ancient artifacts and texts to&nbsp;hieroglyphs and drawings. And he&nbsp;came up&nbsp;with this idea that the pyramids were designed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;energy amplifiers, and some kind of&nbsp;unknown energy source was used during their construction.</p><p>Some people thought Tesla was eccentric for coming up&nbsp;with these theories. But his ideas have actually had a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;the way we&nbsp;think about the pyramids today. Researchers and scholars have been digging into his theories for years and using them to&nbsp;uncover some of&nbsp;the biggest mysteries surrounding these ancient structures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f7f/6ff/c1cc825958a081d1af1d8c9f8b.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>For example, recently scientists have used theoretical physics to&nbsp;investigate how the Great Pyramid of&nbsp;Egypt would react to&nbsp;certain radio waves</u></a>. They found out that if&nbsp;the radio waves were a&nbsp;certain length, the pyramid could concentrate the energy inside its rooms and focus it&nbsp;under its base. The scientists did lots of&nbsp;calculations to&nbsp;figure this out.</p><p>They first thought about what radio wavelengths would work best. Then they made a&nbsp;model of&nbsp;how the pyramid would react to&nbsp;the waves. They figured out how much of&nbsp;the energy from the waves would get absorbed or&nbsp;spread out. Lastly, they checked how the energy would move around inside the pyramid when the waves hit&nbsp;it.</p><p>To&nbsp;help explain all of&nbsp;this, the scientists used something called multipole analysis. This is&nbsp;when you take a&nbsp;complicated object and break it&nbsp;down into simpler parts. Then you can see how each part interacts with the energy that’s coming&nbsp;in. It’s like taking apart a&nbsp;puzzle to&nbsp;see how each piece fits together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/753/7e7/2cbe065b6098247ce66c043006.png><p>The researchers are interested in&nbsp;how all of&nbsp;this can be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;the future. They want to&nbsp;make really tiny particles that can do&nbsp;the same thing as&nbsp;the pyramid but with light. By&nbsp;changing the size, shape, and material of&nbsp;these particles, they can control how the light moves around them. This can be&nbsp;really useful for things like making tiny sensors or&nbsp;super-efficient solar cells. The scientists had to&nbsp;make some guesses when they were doing their research.</p><p>They assumed that there weren’t any hidden spaces inside the pyramid and that the material used to&nbsp;build it&nbsp;was all the same. But even with these guesses, they still made some pretty impressive discoveries. But the Pyramid study is&nbsp;not the only proof that Tesla was ahead of&nbsp;his time. There are more Tesla’s projects that seemed unrealistic at&nbsp;the time, but that scientists and enthusiasts re-evaluate and try to&nbsp;implement today. Let’s talk about Tesla’s most ambitious project: <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>the Wardenclyffe transmission tower</u></a>.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;1900, Tesla was already a&nbsp;big shot when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;electrical engineering in&nbsp;America. People were blown away by&nbsp;his amazing inventions and the fact that he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;outdo Thomas Edison in&nbsp;the “battle of&nbsp;currents.” However, Tesla wasn’t content to&nbsp;rest on&nbsp;his laurels. He&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;embark on&nbsp;his most ambitious project yet: the transmission tower at&nbsp;Wardenclyffe. It&nbsp;was built between 1901 and 1905, and it&nbsp;was based on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Tesla’s breakthrough ideas.</p><p>He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;vision to&nbsp;make the impossible possible by&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;global wireless communication system. It&nbsp;would use Earth itself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;conductor, transmitting music, news, stock market reports, secured military communications, and even facsimile images. Does it&nbsp;sound familiar? Right, it&nbsp;sounds just like the Internet that we&nbsp;use today, only without the use of&nbsp;any wires.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a89/6dc/49298156428f2bf37fe1c78ec5.png><p>But Tesla had a&nbsp;much bigger dream in&nbsp;mind: to&nbsp;transmit power wirelessly. He&nbsp;already proved that high-frequency signals could be&nbsp;sent without any wires using his Tesla coil transformers, and this sparked his obsession with wireless energy transmission.</p><p>His vision was to&nbsp;not only transform the way we&nbsp;communicate, but also to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;transfer power currents globally by&nbsp;tapping into the Earth’s natural energy. Tesla believed that there was an&nbsp;abundance of&nbsp;“free” energy all around&nbsp;us that could be&nbsp;used for humanity’s benefit.</p><p>In&nbsp;1899, he&nbsp;conducted some top-secret experiments and got convinced that it&nbsp;was possible to&nbsp;transmit electrical power through the Earth’s upper atmosphere. This is&nbsp;actually how the Wardenclyffe tower was created. It&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the prototype station for a&nbsp;network of&nbsp;towers all over the globe that would provide the whole world with wireless energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/62a/ff0/b8c56f54fcbe6ef1fbd30c7bf8.png><p>Unfortunately, Tesla didn’t have the resources or&nbsp;the patience of&nbsp;his investors to&nbsp;bring this project to&nbsp;fruition. It&nbsp;ran into all sorts of&nbsp;financial problems and roadblocks, and in&nbsp;1917, the unfinished tower was finally torn down for scrap metal to&nbsp;pay off Tesla’s mounting debts. Now it&nbsp;remains a&nbsp;sad reminder that even the greatest minds can sometimes fall short of&nbsp;their dreams.</p><p>The original red brick laboratory however is&nbsp;still there, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the only Tesla lab that has survived. Fun fact: in&nbsp;2017, a&nbsp;film crew made a&nbsp;crazy discovery. They used ground-penetrating radar to&nbsp;explore the area around Wardenclyffe, and they found a&nbsp;whole series of&nbsp;tunnels stretching for hundreds of&nbsp;feet underneath the site.</p><p>Nobody knows exactly what these tunnels were used for, but people have been speculating for years that they were part of&nbsp;Tesla’s grand plan. Wardenclyffe, of&nbsp;course, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;major landmark for Tesla enthusiasts from all over the world. Who knows&nbsp;— maybe someone will finally crack the mystery of&nbsp;the tunnels one day. But even if&nbsp;they don’t, the legacy of&nbsp;Tesla and his amazing ideas lives&nbsp;on.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGmv8uaZK6mk6TDpr7EnWStoJVirq%2BvyJ6lrWWdrsC1sdGyZKieXam1pnnPsqmapZmZwG6EkG1rcmxf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./15-year-old-singer-wows-the-judges-in-american-idol-early-release-audition.html>&#171;&nbsp;15-Year-Old Singer Wows the Judges in 'American Idol' Early Release Audition</a>
