And, if you’re experiencing back pain, finding the right recliner for your particular needs can be a great way to ease those tired muscles so you can finally relax.</p><p>According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nicole Reiss</a>, PT, DPT, COMT, & Clinic Manager at Potrero Physical Therapy in San Francisco, the best way to scout out a good recliner chair is through trial and error. “I’ll often tell patients to take note of how they feel sitting in different chairs. You can even test chairs when you go to someone else’s house. It doesn’t necessarily mean you buy that particular chair, but do you like sitting in that type of chair? Does it give you good back support? Can your feet rest comfortably on the floor? That’s usually where I advise patients to start out, so you can hone in on the features that will be the best fit.”</p><p>Read on for some of the key features to look out for when you’re shopping for a new recliner chair.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-recliners-for-back-pain>What to consider when buying recliners for back pain</h2><h3>The size of the chair</h3><p>According to Reiss, it’s common to experience discomfort in your recliner chair if it isn’t the right size for your particular body. She explains, “if a smaller person is sitting in a wider chair, that often will not give you enough support. Depth can pose an issue as well. For example, if you can’t sit upright in the chair without your feet dangling, or without the chair cutting into the back of your calves, then the chair might be too deep for you. And if you’re a shorter person, then that might be uncomfortable. So it’s important to find a chair that’s the right size for you.”</p><h3>Comfort features</h3><p>Recliner chairs are available in a wide variety of styles and a range of features. Which features you prioritize though, will depend on what type of back pain you’re experiencing. Reiss shares, “It all depends on what’s going on. For example, heat functions can be very helpful for people experiencing nerve pain, and also arthritic and muscle pain, so if those issues are at play you might consider a recliner with a heat function.” For lower back pain, Reiss says, “lumbar support is key, so you want a chair that has firm padding and support in that lower back area.”</p><p>Some recliners also come with massage functions (like you’d see in a massage chair), which can be beneficial for back pain. Just make sure not to overdo it! Says <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nora Fantry</a>, licensed massage therapist, “It can feel nice to press on muscles that are hurting, but you also want to be gentle and take breaks to make sure you don’t inflame those painful areas with too much pressure.”</p><h3>Your furniture layout</h3><p>As Reiss points out: if you want to make sure your recliner chair is comfortable for you, location is key. “Orientation of the chair is so important. If you’re using the recliner to watch TV, does the chair fit into the space so that you can face the TV dead on? Because if you have to turn your head or neck to focus on what you’re doing, that can cause or exacerbate pain issues. You want the chair to really fit comfortably into that space.”</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-recliners-for-back-pain>Our top picks for best recliners for back pain</h2><h3>Best budget recliner for back pain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Furniwell Massage Recliner Chair</a></h3><p>A sleek design, elegant faux leather, the ability to fully recline, and even massage functions—all at a budget friendly price.

I also considered other factors like price point, color options, size, and style. Then I consulted with experts to better understand what people with different types of back pain might gravitate towards in a recliner chair. Finally, I compared the recommendations of experts against the highest rated options on our list, to select the best recliners for back pain.</p><h2 id=how-recliners-can-help-alleviate-back-pain>How recliners can help alleviate back pain</h2><p>A recliner chair can help alleviate your back pain by allowing you to rest in a comfortable position, or to lay down and take the pressure off of your spine. Depending on the features of the recliner chair, it may also help alleviate back pain through heating or massage functions, or by allowing you to rest in a “zero gravity” position that elevates the feet and reclines the back, enabling a relaxing weightless sensation.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Does a recliner help with back pain?</h3><p>A recliner chair can certainly help alleviate back pain, provided that you select a chair with features to suit your particular pain conditions and needs. It’s key to find a chair that provides comfortable support in any pain areas, like a lumbar cushion for lower back pain, or neck support for upper back and neck pain. Other features, like heat, vibration, and massage functions can also help alleviate an aching back.</p><p>Physical therapists will typically recommend finding a chair that supports good posture and spinal alignment. Says Reiss, “finding a good recliner chair for your particular pain needs is highly dependent on not just your condition, but also how it presents for you specifically—so for best results, always consult your physician.”</p><p>If you are looking for support while you rest, consider investing in a <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress for back pain</a> (or at least a <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress topper for back pain</a>.)</p><h3>How do you sit in a recliner without hurting your back?</h3><p>If your recliner chair is hurting your back, you may have the wrong chair for your needs—or you may just need to take a break! Reiss explains, “no one is going to just sit for 6 hours and feel amazing, so we always recommend that people, if they can, take breaks from sitting to stand up and move around; that’s still one of the best things you can do for your muscles, nerves, and joints.” Reiss also suggests making sure the chair is the right fit for your body, neither too big nor too small, and that the cushions are providing enough support.</p><h3>Why does my back hurt after sitting in a recliner?</h3><p>According to Reiss, “there could be a few reasons. One thing to look at is how soft the chair is: we do like support, so a very squishy chair might be uncomfortable. Also if the chair isn’t giving enough low back, or mid back support, that can lead to discomfort. Because of course, your thoracic spine and your lumbar spine play off each other, so if you’re not getting that upper spine support, that could be an issue. So in short, if your back hurts after sitting in a recliner, look at how deep the chair is, how soft it is, its height, and whether it offers enough support.”</p><h3>Are recliners for back pain suitable for everyone?</h3><p>Each person’s body is unique, so you may have to try out several chairs or even consult your physician if you’re unsure whether or not a recliner chair will alleviate your back pain. But given the wide selection of recliner chairs on the market, and the plethora of available features, styles and designs, most people will find a recliner chair that is comfortable for their body and can help alleviate their back pain.</p><h3>Which recliners are recommended for people with degenerative disc disease?</h3><p>Reiss suggests consulting your doctor for recommendations, as they will be most familiar with your particular symptoms: “Degenerative disc disease can present very differently in different patients, so your body is your best guide for what feels comfortable for you,” she says. “Always consult your doctor with any specific questions or concerns.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lopqwrbXNnqmsZZakv26uwJyiZqiRnrtw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./0-28804-1903155-1903156-1903152-00-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dennis Kozlowski - Top 10 Crooked CEOs</a>
