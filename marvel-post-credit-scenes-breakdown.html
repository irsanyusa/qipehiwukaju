Every single one of their films is part of a “<a href=#>cinematic universe</a>,” an interconnected set of stories that is incomplete unless fans watch each entry in the studio’s output. An essential part of Marvel’s successful strategy to build the world’s biggest film empire has been teasing future movies in mid-credit or post-credit scenes at the end of each film. These <a href=#>post-credit scenes</a> stoke excitement for the next movie and tease how it might relate to the one you just saw.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This strategy has been so successful that just about every big-budget movie — be it spinoff, sequel or prequel — is now part of a “cinematic universe,” whether it be a <a href=#>DC Comics universe</a>, a Lego universe or a <a href=#>Fast and Furious universe</a>. And it’s now the norm to sit through the credits of these films waiting for some sort of teaser that will preview what movie is coming next. This even applies to non-superhero movies like <a href=# rel=noopener>Vice</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Marvel didn’t invent the post-credits scene: Comedic teasers appeared in the credits of The Muppet Movie (1979), Airplane! (1980) and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986). Some films even used the scenes to wrap up plots from the film, like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the 2000s. As franchises became a staple of Hollywood filmmaking, some films would even run the trailer for the next movie after the film, like at the end of The Matrix Reloaded.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Marvel did leverage the post-credit scene as it never had been used before. And beginning in 2008 Marvel Studios’ post-credit scenes built to the events of the <a href=#>epic Avengers: Infinity War </a>and the upcoming <a href=#>Avengers: Endgame</a>.Now that we’re firmly in Phase 4, here’s a breakdown of every single Marvel post-credits scene and how they impacted the larger storyline of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Iron Man (2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/marvel-movies-01.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of the movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) declares, “I am Iron Man” on national television. That prompts <a href=#>Nick Fury</a> (Samuel L. Jackson) to break into Stark’s home in the post-credit scene. “You think you’re the only superhero in the world?” Fury asks the billionaire. “Mr. Stark, you’ve become part of a bigger universe. You just don’t know it yet.” He then introduces himself as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and says he has come to talk about the “Avengers Initiative.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes. This is the first time we see Nick Fury and hear about S.H.I.E.L.D., the counterterrorism organization that eventually will bring the Avengers together. Even before Marvel Studios began production on Iron Man, they planned to eventually film a movie that brought characters with solo films like Iron Man and Hulk together to fight one bad guy, as often happens in comic books. Fury’s use of the word “universe” is intentional: He is hinting to the audience that this film will spawn the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-incredible-hulk.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the first post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) learns how to control his inner Hulk through meditation.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nope. Marvel replaced Norton with Mark Ruffalo and stopped making Hulk solo films. The studio would like you to pretend this movie does not exist.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the second post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tony Stark approaches General Ross (William Hurt), who has been hunting the Hulk throughout the film. Stark says the super-soldier program that created Incredible Hulk villain Abomination “was put on ice for a reason.” We later find out in Captain America: The First Avenger that the government created Captain America (Chris Evans) in the 1940s using a similar serum. Tony then tells Ross, “We’re putting a team together,” teasing the eventual Avengers movie.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not really, but it is further confirmation that an Avengers movie is going to happen. Remember, in 2008 that was a really big deal.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Iron Man 2 (2010)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iron-man-2-best-reviewed-marvel-movies.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) drives into the middle of the desert, gets out of his car and makes a phone call. “Sir, we found it,” he says. The camera then zooms in on the hammer of Thor (Chris Hemsworth).</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes, in that it sets up the model for future Marvel post-credit scenes. The moment was filmed by Thor director Kenneth Branagh and directly teased the next movie in the universe.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Thor (2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/thor.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thor’s friend Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) meets Nick Fury in a lab. Fury opens a briefcase to reveal a blue cube with “unlimited power.” In the background, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) appears and says, “Well I guess that’s worth a look.” Dr. Selvig then repeats Loki’s words. Surprise! Thor’s mischievous brother Loki, who supposedly died at the end of the film, lives on. And he’s controlling what Selvig says and does. Fury seems to be none the wiser, as he leaves the mind-controlled scientist alone in the room with a very valuable object.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Very. Loki will return as the main villain in Avengers and an ancillary character in several future films. We also get our first look at the <a href=#>Tesseract</a>, a MacGuffin that plays a crucial role in Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Captain Marvel. Not only does it hold immense power, but the Tesseract turns out to be an <a href=#>Infinity Stone</a> — one of the stones that <a href=#>Thanos uses to destroy half of all life in the universe</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/captain-america-first-avenger-best-reviewed-marvel-movies.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of the first Captain America movie, Steve Rogers, who has been frozen since 1945, wakes up in modern times. In the post-credits scene, Nick Fury approaches him with a mission to “save the world.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yup. It basically acts as a teaser trailer for the Avengers.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Avengers (2012)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/463363_full.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the first post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We see an alien (credited as The Other) inform a shadowy figure that the Avengers protected Earth from Loki and his alien army. “To challenge them is to court death,” the Other says. The mysterious figure then turns and reveals himself to be Thanos, a purple alien played by Josh Brolin. He smiles. It turns out he was behind Loki’s bid to take over Earth the whole time and gave Loki an army in exchange for the delivery of the Tesseract.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Extremely. Thanos is the biggest of big bads. He will be the man — err, alien — behind the curtain in Guardians of the Galaxy and the featured villain in Avengers: Infinity War. Intriguingly, the “courting death” line suggests that Marvel might have initially considered a different arc for Thanos. In the comics, Thanos collects Infinity Stones because he is in love with Death — yep, the physical manifestation of death — and wants to destroy the universe to impress her. Ultimately, Marvel Studios decided this <a href=# rel=noopener>storyline was too far-fetched</a> for the films. The writers changed his motivation to killing half of all life in the universe for vaguely environmental reasons.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the second post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a callback to Tony’s shawarma line earlier in the film, the super team of superheroes sits and eats their shawarma in silence.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not at all. But fun fact: Director Joss Whedon actually <a href=# rel=noopener>shot the scene</a> the night before the film’s premiere and added to the end of the credits at the last minute. Chris Evans had a beard at the time for the movie Snowpiercer, so he <a href=# rel=noopener>had to hide</a> his face behind his hand.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Iron Man 3 (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iron-man-3-best-reviewed-marvel-movies.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tony Stark seems to be sharing his emotional problems with a therapist, but the camera cuts instead to a sleeping Bruce Banner.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like much of the plot of Iron Man 3, this scene could not be less important to the larger arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Thor: The Dark World (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/thor-the-dark-world-best-reviewed-marvel-movies.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the first post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thor’s allies Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) visit the Collector (Benicio del Toro, doing the most). They give him the Aether — the red substance that gave Dark World baddie Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) power. Volstagg explains that the Aether is an Infinity Stone, and they cannot keep it on Asgard because another Infinity Stone, the Tesseract, is already there. After Volstagg and Siff leave, the Collector ominously says, “One down, five to go.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Extremely. This is the first time the movies confirm that both the Aether and the Tesseract are Infinity Stones. We also learn that there are six Infinity Stones in total. The Collector — who seems extremely untrustworthy — will show up again in Guardians of the Galaxy and offer the audience all the necessary exposition concerning the Infinity Stones.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the second post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thor’s romance with scientist Jane (Natalie Portman) is at the center of this movie.

In the post-credits scene, HYDRA agent Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) predicts that the Avengers will begin rooting out hidden pockets of HYDRA agents. Strucker is keeping Loki’s scepter, which contains the Mind Stone, in his lair. Strucker also reveals that he has two mutants that he created through scientific experimentation locked up in a bunker: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes.

Iron Man kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tony Stark’s death at the end of Avengers: Endgame and Robert Downey Jr. retiring from the franchise marks the end of an era.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-mj-peter-parker.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the first post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Peter Parker takes MJ on their first date: swinging around the city together. They land in Times Square just as a news anchor announces on one of the screens that an anonymous source has leaked a video of Mysterio’s last moments. The news network plays the video that was no doubt sent to them by the henchman of Jake Gyllenhaal’s villain Mysterio (who has since died during a fight with Spider-Man).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the footage, Mysterio claims that Spider-Man is attacking him and that Spidey has plans to kill anyone who tries to take Iron Man’s place. The footage has been recut to make it seem as if Spider-Man ordered an army of drones to execute a group of citizens through Iron Man’s AI technology EDITH. In reality, Spider-Man canceled that order. Mysterio has set him up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jay Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons reprising his role as the Spidey-hating editor from the <a href=#>Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies</a>) then appears onscreen to reveal that his newspaper The Daily Bugle can exclusively report the true identity of Spider-Man: Peter Parker.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Absolutely. Spider-Man: Far From Home spent a lot of time meditating on what a post-Iron Man world might look like. Peter seems the obvious inheritor to the throne and spends the movie reckoning with the responsibility that has been foisted upon him. Several scenes parallel those of the original Iron Man movie: Peter wears Iron Man’s sunglasses, borrows some of his tech and even builds a new suit to the tune of Tony Stark’s favorite song. This ending, too, mirrors the ending of the first Iron Man movie: In that film, Tony Stark reveals during a press conference that he is Iron Man. Now, Spider-Man has been outed too, albeit against his will.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That revelation sets up the events of the next movie. Back in Spider-Man: Homecoming, a villain played by Michael Mando named Mac Gargan (a.k.a. Scorpion) swore that if he ever found out Spider-Man’s identity he would hunt the hero down. Now, all of New York’s supervillains know that Peter Parker is the boy behind the mask. In all likelihood, Scorpion, Vulture (Michael Keaton) and other villains (perhaps the Sinister Six?) will team up to pursue Peter Parker — and the people he loves — in the next movie.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens in the second post-credits scene?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Throughout the movie, Spider-Man has conferred with SHIELD Agents Nick Fury and Maria Hill. But in this second scene, the two characters transform into <a href=#>Skrulls</a>, the shape-shifting alien species from <a href=#>Captain Marvel</a>. We discover that Nick Fury has enlisted Talos, the ostensible villain but actual good guy from that movie, to impersonate him on earth.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Talos calls the real Nick Fury. “People keep asking me where the Avengers are, and I don’t know what to say to that,” he says, panicked. Fury looks to be taking the call on the beach. But then the camera zooms out to reveal that Fury is in fact on a space station filled with Skrulls, likely the new headquarters for SHIELD as the organization prepares to take on increasingly galactic threats.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Definitely. There have always been MCU characters who dwell in space: Thor and the Guardians fo the Galaxy, for instance. But most of the Avengers movies have taken place primarily on earth and dealt with threats on that planet. After the fight with Thanos, Nick Fury has realized that the most dangerous threats lie among the stars, and he is turning his attention there. So, too will the MCU.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many of the upcoming MCU films will likely be set primarily in space: Captain Marvel 2, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and The Eternals among them. A more space-centric focus could also set up a Fantastic Four movie, since that comic centers on a group of scientists who gain their superpowers during a space mission gone wrong.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That means that Spider-Man may also have to expand his territory from New York City to the planet as a whole. He’ll have help from other earth-bound heroes like Black Panther and Shang-Chi.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Black Widow (2021)</i></b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Black-Widow-04.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Black Widow </i>is set in 2016, before the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> or <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. But the post-credits scene is set in 2023 or 2024, after Natasha dies. Yelena (Florence Pugh) visits the grave of her sister, Natasha Romanoff. She has a pup named Fanny with her, which is sweet because she joked to Natasha earlier in the film that she’d like to get a dog.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A recap for those who forgot how Natasha passes away: In <i>Endgame</i>, Natasha and Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, visit the planet where the <a href=#>Red Skull is guarding the Soul Stone</a>. The superhero duo needs the stone to defeat Thanos. The Red Skull tells the two Avengers that one of them must die in order to attain the stone. Each offers to make the ultimate sacrifice, and after a small scuffle, Natasha wins. She leaps off a cliff and dies. A guilt-ridden Hawkeye returns to Avengers headquarters with the stone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Back in 2023/2024, Yelena cleans Natasha’s grave and mourns for her sister. Julia Louis-Drefyus’ Valentina Allegra de Fontaine—a big bad who briefly popped up in <i>Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i>—appears. Yelena works as an assassin for Val but tells her boss that she’s on vacation. “Maybe you’d like a shot at the man responsible for your sister’s death,” Val says, showing Yelena a picture of Hawkeye. Technically, Val’s not wrong about Hawkeye’s role in Black Widow’s death.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you are at all invested in either the television series <i>Hawkeye</i> or Yelena’s future, then absolutely, it does. Yelena dropped into the Disney+ show starring Jeremy Renner’s Hawkeye and his newfound ward, Hailee Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop, and tried to kill the Avenger. As the two tangle with each other—and (spoiler alert) Clint eventually convinces Yelena that he tried to stop Natasha from sacrificing herself—Yelena develops a begrudging friendship with Kate. Marvel is almost certainly setting up some sort of team-up project involving these two young actors.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)</i></b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SFT1990_cmp_wta_v0162.1048.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the first post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of <i>Shang-Chi</i>, Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong) summons Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his friend Katy (Awkwafina) to discuss the magical Ten Rings that Shang-Chi now has in his possession. In the post-credits scene, a group of Avengers—Wong, Bruce Banner, and Captain Marvel—study the rings and determine that they are sending some sort of beacon but cannot figure out the signal’s destination. Wong says the rings aren’t in his magical codex. Banner says the rings must be ancient since they don’t contain any modern technology. And Captain Marvel confirms they’re not alien tech.

It’s likely that Xialing will show up as a villain either in the next <i>Shang-Chi </i>film or in a Disney+ series.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Eternals (2021)</i></b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MES7050_comp_v151.1034_R2_COMP.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the first post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the movie, the Eternals discovered that the Celestial Arishem planned to destroy Earth and foiled his plans. After they succeed, Arishem promises retribution and plucks Sersi (Gemma Chan), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), and Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry) from the planet. Arishem says he will search the three Eternals’ memories to determine whether the human race is worthy of survival and will return for judgment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the <a href=#>first mid-credits scene</a>, Angelina Jolie’s Thena, Lauren Ridloff’s Makkari, and Barry Keoghan’s Druig speculate about who could have kidnapped the other Eternals. Suddenly, Pip the Troll (a drunken alien voiced by Patton Oswald) appears to announce the entrance of Starfox, played by none other than Harry Styles. Pip introduces Starfox as an Eternal and the brother of Thanos. Starfox also goes by Eros, an illusion to the god of love, an appropriate title for anyone played by Styles. “Your friends are in big trouble,” Starfox tells the rest of the Eternals. “And we know where to find them.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Given <i>Eternals’</i> middling box office returns, it’s unclear if the movie will get a sequel. But if it does, Harry Styles’ Eros/Starfox will certainly be joining the rest of the Eternals in their quest to save Sersi, Kingo, and Phastos. If Starfox is the (adoptive) brother of Thanos, that means that Gamora and Nebula are his nieces. Is it possible Starfox could pop up in the next <i>Guardians of the Galaxy </i>film?</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the second post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kit Harington’s Dane Whitman spent most of <i>Eternals</i> mooning after his immortal girlfriend Sersi. But he does tell Sersi that his family history is “complicated” and that he’s recently discovered an old family secret. After Sersi disappears, he goes to a box presumably passed down to him by relatives and opens it. Inside it is an ancient-looking sword. The box is labeled “mors mihi lucrum,” which means “death is my reward.” The sword seems to call to him, and Dane says, to no one in particular, “I’m sorry. I have to try.” Perhaps he knows the sword is evil and will corrupt him but thinks it might help him get back Sersi.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As he reaches for it a mysterious voice calls into the room, “Sure you’re ready for that, Mr. Whitman?” The voice belongs to Mahershala Ali who is set to play the vampire hunter Blade in a future MCU film.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the comics, Dane is the nephew of Nathan Garrett, the villainous Black Knight.

Confused? We are a little, too.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before Tom Holland’s Spider-Man swung onto the scene, Sony owned exclusive rights to Spider-Man, which meant that Peter Parker could not play a role in Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. But the two studios struck a deal: Sony would lend Marvel the character for MCU team-up movies like <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, and Marvel Studios would lend characters like Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange for Spidey films. Meanwhile, Sony would begin to build its own superhero cinematic universe centered on Spider-Man’s world, including foes like vampire Morbius and the alien parasite Venom.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Venom, for those who skipped Sony’s wacky movies on the anti-hero, is housed in the body of journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). After several misadventures, the odd couple of Brock and Venom have come to something of a truce: Venom doesn’t eat human brains and Brock finds chickens for him to eat. Together they fight meaner, scarier alien parasites. So, basically, Venom is a good guy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Until, in a post-credits scene for the Venom sequel, <i>Let There Be Carnage</i>, Venom and Eddie get transported into a parallel universe. Once there, Venom sees Peter Parker’s Spider-Man on TV and wants to eat him. Presumably, Venom got sucked into Peter’s universe after Doctor Strange’s spell to make everyone in the world forget that Peter was Spider-Man went awry, summoning villains from across the multiverse who knew Peter’s secret identity. Admittedly, the logic here is shaky at best: As far as we know, Venom has never even heard of Spider-Man, let alone discovered his secret identity like Doctor Octopus or Green Goblin. But just go with it. The stinger suggested that Venom might make his way from San Francisco to New York to attack Peter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No such luck. Venom doesn’t show up for the entire runtime of <i>Spider-Man: No Way Home </i>proper, only in the mid-credits scene. There, we see Eddie chatting with a bartender (played by <i>Ted Lasso</i>’s Cristo Fernández) about what Spider-Man’s whole deal is. Eddie and Venom are just preparing themselves to make the journey to Queens to have a chat with the young superhero when they get sucked back into their universe. However, a dollop of Venom goo is left behind.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Is Venom now somehow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? It’s unclear. Disney doesn’t own the rights to that character. Perhaps the studios are leaving the option open just in case they do decide to collaborate on future Spider-Man movies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Spider-Man: No Way Home</i> ended with a number of lingering questions: Is Holland’s Peter Parker going to show up in another movie? (Unclear.) Which studio will make that movie? (Also unclear.) Currently nobody knows him in the MCU, which would mean throwing him into another universe would be simple, but then why leave a bit of Venom behind in the MCU? (I really have no answers here.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perhaps Spider-Man will remain in his world, but nobody will remember him, so he’ll just exist in this weird anonymous pocket of the universe where he only ever encounters Sony characters.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the second post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The second post-credits scene is a trailer for <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i>.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Only insofar as it got audiences interested in seeing the next Marvel movie—and suggested that the multiverse will continue to play a big role in this cinematic universe.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)</i></b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dr-strange.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the first post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the end of <i>Multiverse of Madness</i>, Doctor Strange is strolling down the street when suddenly he feels a terrible pain in his head, and a third eye appears.

Clea is the niece of Dormammu, the interdimensional entity that Doctor Strange caught in a time loop at the end of <i>Doctor Strange</i>. She also marries Stephen Strange in the comics, so it’s good that Strange recently got over his crush on Chrstine (Rachel McAdams).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The threat of incursions could also give us a hint as to where the MCU is headed. We learn in <i>Multiverse of Madness</i> that travel across the multiverses has consequences. Stay in any one universe too long, and you may cause an incursion, and when two universes collide, only one survives. Incursions played a major role in the comics storyline <i>Secret Wars</i>, which first debuted in the 1980s and was revisited in 2015. The plot is complicated and involves a number of characters who we have not met (yet) in the MCU, like <i>Fantastic Four’</i>s Doctor Doom. But basically, every universe in the multiverse is destroyed as a result of incursions except for two, and those two universes battle it out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fans have been speculating for years that Marvel will use a <i>Secret Wars-</i>esque plotline to bring together characters from different universes. Right now, all of the main action in the MCU has taken place on Earth-616. In <i>Multiverse of Madness</i>, Doctor Strange also visits Earth-838 where the Illuminati captured him. Marvel could neatly introduce the characters from <i>X-Men </i>and <i>Fantastic Four</i> in yet another universe and fold them into a <i>Secret Wars</i> plot.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the second post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Early in the film, Doctor Strange curses the self-proclaimed Pizza Papa (played with comedic panache by Bruce Campbell) to punch himself for a week.

Also there’s always the chance that the audience will start chanting “Roy Kent” in movie theaters, which is a fun prospect.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>What happens in the second post-credits scene?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster (wearing, by the way, a not-particularly-convincing wig) finds herself at the gates of Valhalla. During the movie, she finally succumbed to cancer, and died in Thor’s arms. But since she wielded Thor’s hammer Mjölinir and fought as Thor herself before she died, she has been granted entrance to Valhalla, where Viking warriors travel in the afterlife. She is greeted by Idris Elba’s Heimdall, the all-seeing god who guarded the Bifrost bridge and Thor’s best friend. Thanos killed Heimdall early in <i>Avengers: Infinity War, </i>but not before Heimdall heroically used his last breath to send Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) to Warth to warn the Avengers of Thanos’ plans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Heimdall thanks Jane for helping to save his son from the clutches of Gorr and welcomes her to paradise.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Does this scene matter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?</b></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Again, who knows if this teaser will eventually manifest in some movie or television series set in Valhalla. Natalie Portman and Idris Elba feel like they’re way too famous to wind up, say, on a Disney+ show—but I would have said the same of Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke a few years ago, and they just wrapped up <i>Moon Knight</i>. But neither Elba or Portman ever really got their due in these movies—Marvel Studios has a bad habit of occasionally wasting incredible talent—so if they wanted their own spinoff, I bet the studio would be happy to film it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWFrg3p%2BjqaYq66VoXqxu9KtZJyqlZm2tXnSnJynnaNir7OxwKSbqK%2BeZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./content-delivery-networks-complicate-debate-net-neutrality.html>&#171;&nbsp;Content Delivery Networks Complicate Debate Over Net Neutrality</a>
