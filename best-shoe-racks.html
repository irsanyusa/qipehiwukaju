Though I predominantly wear the same pair of black <a rel=nofollow href=#>1460 Doc Marten boots</a>, I possess a rather large collection. Part of the reason for this is, of course, the need for activity specific shoes suitable for things like running, cycling, hiking, walking, and snow. I have a specific pair (the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ugg Classic Mini</a>) I throw on when taking the garbage out or just running to the corner bodega for some milk. I own multiple pairs of boots in varying heights and styles as well as shoes that are comfortable for a long day of standing, heels that simply look beautiful, platforms I can actually walk in, and that one pair of absolutely amazing Louboutin’s that I found on sale and have only worn once because they’re just that special and I don’t want to damage them. Essentially, I have a lot of shoes.</p><p>If you’re like me you probably know that the main problematic thing about shoes is that they can be difficult to store in a neat and orderly way. I confess to being one of those people with an unruly mound of footwear at the bottom of my extremely small bedroom closet (sound familiar?). Or maybe your shoes pile up by the front door of your home where you routinely trip over a wayward loafer, or perhaps you live in a house with a large family and find yourself often hunting for a particular pair’s mate.</p><p>Shoe organization can seem overwhelming, but the good news is that there are lots of possible storage solutions appropriate for a range of spaces and budgets. To help compile a guide of the best options, I talked to some people who have made organizing their profession. Read on to learn how to make shoe storage more of an art and less of a mess.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-shoe-rack>Our top picks for the best shoe rack</h2><h3>Best shoe rack for closets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Container Store Elfa Classic 4’ Shoe Wall Solution</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best shoe rack for closets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>The Container Store Elfa Classic 4’ Shoe Wall Solution</h3></p><p>For a dedicated shoe storage solution in a closet, nothing beats a 4-foot shoe wall from Elfa. It comes with both gliding shoe racks and solid décor shelves to hold up to 104 pairs of shoes, boots, and heels. A closet rod adds space to hang tall boots on hooks and the flat shelves provide the perfect perch for those special shoes you prefer to keep in boxes. The Elfa system mounts to the wall via the top vertical piece only.</p><p>As Dunn said, “If you have the ability to go vertical with your shoe storage, like a shoe wall or vertical shoe rack, that will maximize your shoe storage space.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 16” L x 48” W x 84” H</li><li>Material: Steel and solid birch</li><li>Price on publish: $1,314</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Adjustable and customizable</li><li>Holds up to 104 pairs of shoes and boots</li><li>Easy to install</li><li>Available in White, Platinum, and Graphite</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This wall mounted shoe storage solution from Elfa comes with three adjustable décor shelves, five adjustable gliding shelves, and a hanging rod for tall boots.</p><h3>Best shoe rack for small spaces: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Container Store 24-Pocket Over-the-Door Shoe Organizer</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best shoe rack for small spaces</span></p><p><h3 class=title>The Container Store 24-Pocket Over-the-Door Shoe Organizer</h3></p><p>Dunn, Aiello, and Weiss all recommended over the door shoe organizers for small spaces. “[These] maximize vertical space,” said Weiss. “They’re excellent for storing flats, sandals, or athletic shoes.

The mesh shelves can be installed at an angle for easy viewing (the lipped edge keeps shoes from walking off on their own) or flat and flipped the other way. Each shelf is 10.75 inches deep and holds up to nine pairs of men’s shoes. They’re spaced 7.875 inches apart, so they won’t work for tall boots.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 11.875” L x 29.25” W x 28.75” H</li><li>Material: Steel and wood</li><li>Price on publish: $79.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Very sturdy</li><li>Comes in two colors: Graphite and White</li><li>Shelves can be installed flat or angled</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Pricey for a small shelf</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Sturdy and stylish 3-tier steel and wood shoe storage solution with mesh shelves that can be installed flat or angled.</p><h3>Best shoe storage set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Haixin Narrow Shoe Rack</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best shoe storage set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Narrow Shoe Rack - 5 Tiers Stackable Shoe Storage Stand for Entryway Hallway and Closet Durable Shoe Shelf Space Saving Boots Storage and Organization Stylish Small Shoe Cabinet No-Tool Assembly Khaki</h3></p><p>This set of plastic shoe storage cubbies provides space for sneakers, high heels, and tall boots depending on how you construct them.

If you have small closets, you may want to use an over the door hanging shoe organizer. Or consider a dedicated shoe cabinet that will live outside your closet; many of them have stylish doors or drawers and a narrow silhouette so they’ll fit in a hallway or behind a door. If you have a walk-in closet space, a dedicated, custom shoe wall may provide the best solution.</p><p>“Organizing shoes can be a challenge, but with the right strategies, you can create a functional and visually appealing shoe storage system,” Heather Aiello, founder at <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Organized You</a> told me. When figuring out your strategy, make sure to take into account vertical space. This will ensure that you’ll really maximize your storage options, said Sarah Dunn, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>ReadySetOrganize</a> in San Diego, California.</p><p>To begin your organizing journey, invest in sturdy shoe racks or shelves, said Sarit Weiss, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Neat & Orderly</a>. “Adjustable racks accommodate different shoe sizes, and open shelves make it easy to see and access your shoes. Consider placing these near the entrance of your closet for convenience,” she said. These options can sometimes be found at <a rel=alternate href=#>online furniture stores</a>. They may also offer other solutions including built-in shelves, hanging organizers, modular cubbies, and <a rel=alternate href=#>storage beds</a>.</p><h3>Number of shoes</h3><p>“If you have a large collection, custom shelving in your closet can be designed specifically for your shoes,” said Aiello. If that’s out of your budget, consider a modular plastic cube system that you can arrange in a variety of configurations. If there’s a shoe rack or shelf you like, purchase more than one to accommodate the number of pairs you own. Look for components that are stackable and adjustable.</p><h3>Cubbies, racks, or shelves</h3><p>“These can be installed in closets, entryways, or even under benches,” said Aiello. Shoe cubbies provide designated spaces for each pair which prevents them from getting mixed up, while a rack or shelf allows you to store more pairs in the same amount of space. Shelves and racks can run the risk of getting messy or jumbled up. You’ll have to put in a bit of an effort to ensure each pair is arranged neatly on its perch.</p><p>Clear shoe boxes are another option. You can stack them on shelves or just on each other. “They’re great for visibility and keeping your shoes dust-free,” said Aiello.</p><h3>Budget</h3><p>Shoe walls and shoe cabinet furniture pieces tend to be more expensive than something like a small 3-tier shoe rack or an over the door canvas hanging organizer. If you have less than $100 to spend, canvas shoe organizers offer a great budget friendly solution.</p><p>Whichever system you decide on, consider rotating your shoes seasonally to keep the most relevant footwear easily accessible. “This practice not only keeps your closet organized but also helps you assess which shoes are due for cleaning or repair,” said Weiss.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-shoe-storage-solutions>How we selected the best shoe storage solutions</h2><p>I drew from my personal experience as a wardrobe and costume professional for film, television, and fashion as well as on the advice and knowledge of professional organizers to come up with a range of storage ideas for different budgets, spaces, and style preferences. All the choices were considered based on quality, functionality, adjustability, and overall value.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do I maximize my shoe storage space?</h3><p>If you’re able, going vertical remains the best way to maximize storage space. If you have the room (and an available, empty wall), install shelving or bins that extend all the way to the ceiling. If that’s not a possibility in your home, consider an over the door hanging shoe rack or under the bed storage options. For the latter, Aiello suggested using them for seasonal or rarely worn shoes which will help free up some of your closet space.</p><h3>How do you organize a lot of shoes in a small space?</h3><p>As far as small spaces go, the over the door hanging shoe rack earns top billing; all of the experts I talked to suggested them. Another option to consider, according to Aiello, is a vertical organizer that can be placed behind a door.</p><h3>Is it better to keep shoes in boxes or out?</h3><p>“It's always best to keep shoes out of boxes to minimize the space they take up and so you can actually see and wear them,” said Dunn.</p><h3>Is it OK to store leather shoes in plastic containers?</h3><p>“Leather shoes can be damaged by excess moisture,” said Amelia Pleasant Kennedy, certified life coach and professional organizer of <a rel=nofollow href=#>A Pleasant Solution</a> in Birmingham, Michigan. Before storing them in a plastic shoe box, make sure you let them fully dry for a day or two.</p><p>To help maintain the shape of the shoe, Kennedy suggested adding an insert or stuffing them with paper. Also, use a leather moisturizer and utilize a cobbler service if the shoes begin to show wear.</p><p>“I think for most of us, we're wearing our shoes, we're using them,” she added, “I don't think you're going to do too much damage by keeping them in plastic containers.”</p><p>One last piece of parting advice: “I would just say the most affordable solution is the one that allows you to access, appreciate, and wear the shoes that you own,” said Kennedy. best-shoe-rack-time-20</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo528pnnRmpqkq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fangirls-yve-blake-one-direction-musical-london-1236093702.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fangirls Fever: Creator Yve Blake on the One Direction-Inspired Musicals Wild L</a>
