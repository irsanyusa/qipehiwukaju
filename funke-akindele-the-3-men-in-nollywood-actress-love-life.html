Pulse has also reached out to Funke Akindele to find out if she is engaged. We are waiting for her reply also.</p><p>While Funke Akindele is one of the biggest Nollywood actors, her love life has been very private. The '' actress is very secretive about her love life and doesn't like to reveal who she is dating or seeing. From her long and illustrious career which started from the educative drama series ' there have only been three men that have been (allegedly) associated with the actress publicly.</p><p>These three men are Nollywood actor <strong>Femi Adebayo</strong>, 43, <strong>Kehinde Oloyede</strong> her former husband, and most recently JJC Skillz whose real name is&nbsp; <strong>Abdul Rasheed Bello</strong>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Who are these men? Read below to know more about their ties with one of Nigeria's richest and most successful actresses.</p><p>1) <strong>Femi Adebayo</strong></p><p>Legend has it that Femi Adebayo and Funke Akindele were in a hot affair back in the day. Let's not forget that both Femi and Funke are prominent Yoruba actors, and they must have met a lot on the set of many Yoruba movies. The stories of the two together were too strong to ignore.</p><p>The only snag during this rumoured love affair was that Femi Adebayo was married. Unconfirmed gist says Femi Adebayo's&nbsp; marriage crashed because of his romance with Funke Akindele. Both actors have denied this rumour vehemently.</p><p>In 2009, Funke Akindele spoke about the rumour. "A lot has been said, especially about Femi Adebayo and Femi is a colleague and I have worked with him on so many projects including mine. I use this medium to clear the air now that i am not dating Femi Adebayo, neither am I pregnant for him according to what I have heard and read. I also categorically state here that I did not snatch anybody's husband" Funke Akindele told <strong>Stella Dimokokorkus</strong>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In June 2015, Femi Adebayo granted an interview to <strong>City People</strong>, and stated that Funke Akindele had nothing to do with his marriage not working.</p><p>"Funke had nothing to do with my marriage crash. The major reason my marriage broke-up was the fact that my baby mother does not really like my profession. Funke absolutely has nothing to do with my marriage problems. And I want people to get this clear" stated the award winning actor.</p><p>2) <strong>Kehinde Oloyede</strong></p><p>Funke Akindele got married to Kehinde 'Almaroof' Oloyede on May 26, 2012. It was the most talked about marriage of the year. Also Funke Akindele's marriage would go down as one of the shortest celebrity marriages in Nigeria. On July 15, 2013 it was announced that Funke Akindele's marriage had crashed.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Kehinde Oloyede made the separation known on his Facebook account before taken it down. "It’s with heavy heart that am announcing the separation of me nd ma wife Mrs olufunke akindele, we’ve both agreed to go our separate ways coz of irreconcilable differences. we still best of friends nd we 4ever remain gud friends" wrote Kehinde on his Facebook account.</p><p>He later added "Am doing just fine, gettn along without u,don’t need u anymore in ma life.u d greatest mistake av made in recent time."</p><p>Funke Akindele later confirmed her marriage was indeed over. "On behalf of our client, star actress, Funke Akindele, we want to formally inform you that after due consultation and consideration, she’s now separated from Mr. Kehinde Oloyede as his wife. She hereby urges her fans and all concerned to pray and wish her the best as she moves on in her career. Kindly note that this is the first and only official statement from Funke Akindele on the matter and will be glad if her wish is respected. Thank you" read the official statement from her reps.</p><p>She later granted an interview to Stella Dimokokorkus about her marriage. "It’s my private life, I know I am a public figure but I am entitled to some privacy at least. What has happened has happened, No one is beyond mistakes. I will take corrections from this and apply where necessary from now on. I bear Mr Kehinde Oloyede no ill feelings" said the actress in a telephone interview with the blogger.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On January 19, 2016 it was rumoured that veteran pop star JJC who practically discovered <strong>D'banj</strong> and <strong>Don Jazzy</strong><a href=# id=58e83ad6-1ef6-5ae4-883b-7337a304c114>was dating Funke Akindele</a>. Some say that Funke is so in love with JJC that she moved to his home in Ikate, Lekki.</p><p>A month later we are now hearing stories of the two celebrities are now enegaged. According to<strong> Entertainment Express</strong> Funke Akindele was overwhelmed and moved to tears when JJC went down on one knee and asked her to be his wife.</p><p>Well, it could be a publicity stunt. If you check both their Instagram accounts, it is clear that the two are working on a project of some sort.</p><p>It might however be real love though. If this story is indeed true then we are happy for the two of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGafrZ6gsm6tyqKlnZ2cmnq1tMRmamallaN6qrqMp6alpKmsvLCwjJqaraqVqMBuuM6vnGakmZuycK7MqpubbWE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./catherine-mayer.html>&#171;&nbsp;We Might Not Want Our Life Extended</a>
