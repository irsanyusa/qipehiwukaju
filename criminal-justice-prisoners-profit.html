She keeps her bills in a freezer bag under her bed, next to old photo albums, and believes in paying them on time religiously. For Taylor, living within your means is part of being a good Christian.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lately, Taylor, 64, has felt torn between that commitment and her desire to be a loving, supportive mother for her son Eddie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eddie, 38, is serving 20-year prison sentence at <a href=# rel=noopener>Bland Correctional Center</a> for armed robbery. He’s doing his time at a medium-security Virginia state prison located 137 miles northwest of Johnson City, across the dips and valleys of the Blue Ridge Mountains here in the heart of Appalachia. The cost of supporting and visiting Eddie keeps going up, so Pat makes trade-offs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I would send him money even if it broke me, because I do go without paying some bills sometimes to go see him,” Pat says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Between gas to make the trip and overpriced sandwiches from the prison vending machine, visiting Bland costs about $50, a strain on her housekeeper’s wages. So she alternates, visiting Eddie one week and sending him money the next.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To get cash to her son, Pat used to purchase a money order at the post office for $1.25 and mail it to the prison, for a total cost of less than $2. But in March of last year, the Virginia Department of Corrections informed her that <a href=# rel=noopener>JPay Inc.</a>, a private company in Florida, would begin handling all deposits into inmates’ accounts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sending a money order through JPay takes too long, so Taylor started using her debit card to get him funds instead. To send Eddie $50, <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor must pay</a> $6.95 to JPay. Depending on how much she can afford to send, the fee can be as high as 35 percent. In other states, JPay’s fees approach 45 percent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After the fee, the state takes out another 15 percent of her money for court fees and a mandatory savings account, which Eddie will receive upon his release in 2021, minus the interest, which goes to the Department of Corrections.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eddie needs money to pay for basic needs like toothpaste, visits to the doctor and winter clothes. In some states families of inmates pay for toilet paper, electricity, even room and board, as governments increasingly shift the costs of imprisonment from taxpayers to the families of inmates.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“To give him $50, I have to send $70 off my card,” says Taylor, who moved to a smaller apartment on the outskirts of Johnson City in part because of the rising cost of supporting Eddie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They’re punishing the families, not the inmates.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Price of prison</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay and other prison bankers collect tens of millions of dollars every year from inmates’ families in fees for basic financial services. To make payments, some forego medical care, skip utility bills and limit contact with their imprisoned relatives, <a href=# rel=noopener>the Center for Public Integrity</a> found in a six-month investigation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inmates earn as little as 12 cents per hour in many places, wages that have not increased for decades. The prices they pay for goods to meet their basic needs continue to increase.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By erecting a virtual tollbooth at the prison gate, JPay has become a critical financial conduit for an opaque constellation of vendors that profit from millions of poor families with incarcerated loved ones.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay streamlines the flow of cash into prisons, making it easier for corrections agencies to take a cut. Prisons do so directly, by deducting fees and charges before the money hits an inmate’s account. They also allow phone and commissary vendors to charge marked-up prices, then collect a share of the profits generated by these contractors.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Taken together, the costs imposed by JPay, phone companies, prison store operators and corrections agencies make it far more difficult for poor families to escape poverty so long as they have a loved one in the system.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Shifting costs to families</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s not just the money transfer that’s the problem, it’s the system it enables to shift costs onto families,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Lee Petro</a>, an attorney who helped litigate for a national cap on some prison phone rates. Without companies like JPay, he says, “it would be much harder to take money from families and make families of inmates pay their own keep.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 12 years, JPay says it has grown to provide money transfers to more than 1.7 million offenders in 32 states, or nearly 70 percent of the inmates in U.S. prisons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For the families of nearly 40 percent of those prisoners, JPay is the only way to send money to a loved one. Others can choose between JPay and a handful of <a href=# rel=noopener>smaller companies</a>, most of them <a href=# rel=noopener>created by phone and commissary vendors</a> to compete with the industry leader. Western Union also serves some prisons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay handled nearly 7 million transactions in 2013, generating well over $50 million in revenue. It expects to transfer more than $1 billion this year. (The company declined to provide any financial details; those included in this article are culled from public records and interviews with current and former employees.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jpayshapiro.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We invented this business,” said Ryan Shapiro, 37, the company’s founder and CEO, in a phone interview in June. “Everyone else tries to imitate what we did, and they don’t do it as well.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro says working with corrections includes extra costs for security and software integration. He says he charges only as much as he must to maintain a razor-thin profit margin.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But others provide similar services for less.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>NIC Inc.</a>, a competitor that helps states set up their websites, charges a flat fee of $2.40 in Maine to send money to inmates. Until recently, Arkansas charged 5 percent to send money through the state’s own Web portal. Floridians <a href=# rel=noopener>pay a fee</a> of 3.5 percent to handle traffic tickets online.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite its kudzu-like growth, JPay so far has avoided scrutiny by consumer regulators.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response to questions for this story, however, the New York Department of Financial Services’ consumer division is reviewing the company’s practices, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to discuss active investigations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay’s rapid rise stems in part from the generous deal it offers many prison systems. <a href=# rel=noopener>They pay nothing</a> to have JPay take over handling financial transfers. And for every payment it accepts in these states — prisoners typically receive about one per month — the company sends between 50 cents and $2.50 back to the prison operator. These profit-sharing arrangements, which vendors offer as deal-sweeteners in contract negotiations, are known in the industry as “commissions.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay’s payments to Illinois last year came to about $4,000 a month, according to documents obtained under the state’s open records law.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jails often deduct intake fees, medical co-pays or the cost of basic toiletries first, leaving the account with a negative balance. This prevents inmates from buying “optional” supplies like stationery or sturdier shoes until they have paid down the debt.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Such charges levied by jails for common items are not new. The practice began prior to the rise of JPay, mainly with phone companies and operators of prison stores. But by automating the process, prison bankers make it a lot easier.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>$100 underwear</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Negative account balances discourage cash-strapped people from helping relatives, says Linda Dolan, 58, a manager for a defense contractor in California. Last year, when her son was sentenced to 20 days in jail in <a href=# rel=noopener>St. Lucie County</a>, Florida, for reckless driving, Linda wanted to buy him a second pair of underwear and socks. But the county’s intake fee and daily “rent” already had put the account about $70 in the red. Linda and her husband both were out of work and couldn’t afford to pay $100 for a pair of underwear.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If relatives are putting money on somebody’s books while they’re an inmate, it’s to help them buy necessities,” Linda says. “I didn’t think it was right that the county was stealing the money.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Capt. William Lawhorn of the St. Lucie County sheriff’s office said that inmates are charged a $25 initial booking fee, $3 a day for “subsistence” and medical co-pays, all of which can result in a negative balance. He said nobody is denied any type of needed service or care, and when inmates do have money, it’s used for candy and other junk food. Inmates in the county receive payments through <a href=# rel=noopener>Touchpay</a>, a JPay competitor that often partners with foodservice giant Aramark.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Funding prisons out of the pockets of families and inmates has non-financial costs too, says Brian Nelson, who spent 28 years in an Illinois state prison for murder. Nelson says he has “become an asset to society” since he was released four years ago because he stayed in touch with family and priests even when he was in solitary confinement. When inmates can’t afford to maintain contact with the outside world, he says, they are less equipped to transition smoothly to civilian life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The effect on poor families is especially harsh, Nelson says: “It’s a wife that has three children at home, and her husband is in jail, so now she has a choice: Do I send money to him so he can afford to stay in touch with the kids, or do I feed the kids?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inmates’ need for money is inescapable, Nelson says. Those in northern Illinois are not issued cold-weather clothes, he says, leaving them vulnerable to frostbite unless they can get money to pay for prison-approved long underwear and boots.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Razor thin margins</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay founder Shapiro is eager to tell his company’s story and how he believes it helps families. It’s not just about faster payments. Once an inmate gains access to the money, JPay offers several ways to spend it, including <a href=# rel=noopener>pay-per-page e-messaging</a>, music downloads and <a href=# rel=noopener>MP3 players</a>. When inmates in some states are released, they receive their remaining money on JPay-branded <a href=# rel=noopener>payment cards</a> that carry higher fees than those on most consumer payment cards.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro says that if his fees were any lower, his company would lose money. He declined to make the company’s financial details available and would not say how much he is paid.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro serves on the board of a foundation that advocates for inmates and carries full-page ads for JPay in its newsletters. The foundation received an $85,400 gift directly from JPay’s corporate treasury in 2009.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He lives on a tiny harbor island near the northern tip of Miami Beach in a home he bought for about a million dollars. Last year, through a company he controls called El Caballero LLC., Shapiro bought a <a href=# rel=noopener>custom powerboat</a>, dubbed Sea Block, that retails for a half-million dollars.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Heading to the company’s headquarters one July morning, he stopped first for CrossFit, a military-style training regime that he enjoys because it brings out his competitive side, then for daily prayer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Families who use JPay love the company, he says. He boasts of its well-trafficked <a href=# rel=noopener>Web forum</a> and of the 174,000 “likes” on <a href=# rel=noopener>its Facebook page</a>, where its marketers post cheery articles about incarceration. “The Jail Cats program at Gwinnett County Detention Center in Georgia is rescuing kittens and helping to rehabilitate incarcerated women,”<a href=# rel=noopener>one recent post</a> read.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We go out of our way to make sure that they feel comfortable — that, you know, you’re spending money with a company that cares about you,” Shapiro says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If people don’t want to pay his fees, Shapiro says, they can always mail a money order, except in the “couple of states” that now charge fees for them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nearly 400,000 people are imprisoned in states where there is no free deposit option, a fact Shapiro was unaware of during a series of interviews this summer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When it’s up to us, it’s absolutely free,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Slow-moving money orders</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For the first 14 years of Eddie’s sentence, Pat Taylor mailed money orders directly to the prison at no charge beyond the cost of the money order and a stamp. Then last year, she was instructed to make the money order out to JPay and send it to a Florida post office box. The company would credit it to Eddie’s account.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Under the new system, she says, it would take weeks for Eddie to see funds sent via money order. So Pat, like nearly everyone else she knows, gave in and began paying $6.95 to send the money from her debit card.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Across the country, delays and other obstacles make the “free option” inaccessible to many families, the Center found. More than a dozen families in five different states said that money orders have been credited much more slowly since JPay took over.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro says he is “absolutely shocked” by the complaints that money orders are delayed because he had never heard of such problems before. Most money orders are processed within two to three days, he said, unless the person sending money fails to fill out the form properly. He said Virginia is especially efficient and processes money orders within 24 to 48 hours.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We are not slowing it down, there is no conspiracy,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He said JPay does “want people to convert from a money order customer to a digital customer, absolutely,” but only because electronic payments are more efficient. “We’re not trying to make an extra dollar everywhere we can,” Shapiro said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before JPay, Virginia prisons credited money orders to inmates’ accounts in roughly three days, families say. Today, money orders can take more than a month to reach an inmate’s account, Marvin Rodriguez-Barrera, an inmate at Virginia’s high-security Red Onion State Prison, wrote in a letter to prisoners’ rights advocates in February.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Faster to Guatemala</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I am from Central America, and it is cheaper for my family, and easier, to send money to Guatemala than for my family to send me money from this very state!” Rodriguez-Barrera wrote. “The old way of using money orders was cheaper, easier and in many instances faster.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those seeking to avoid the fees by sending a money order must print and fill out a JPay-provided <a href=# rel=noopener>form</a> whose instructions are dwarfed by large print barking at them to “Put down your pen! Put away your car keys!” because “There’s a faster way to send money, go to JPay.com and sign up now!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The aggressive marketing has worked. One former marketing director for the company lists as a key accomplishment on his LinkedIn profile that he “Converted 78 percent” of money order users to online users, boosting the company’s annual revenue by $985,000.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro said the information in the profile, including the former employee’s title, was inaccurate. He said he didn’t have data on how many money order users convert to electronic payments or how much revenue the company gains when they make the switch.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inside JPay’s secure, fishbowl-like money order processing room, reams of envelopes sit in postal bins on the shelves. Signs around the room remind the handful of workers employed there which states allow them to deduct a fee and which offer the service for free.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Pennsylvania, the first state where JPay accepted money orders by mail, executives were surprised to see the number of money orders plunge by two-thirds in the first two months, Chief Financial Officer Mark Silverman explained in a brief interview.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro said that Missouri used to process 30,000 money orders a month before JPay came in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“With JPay, we drove that down to only 1,000 people sending money,” he says. “And that’s by choice.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay’s marketing materials urge customers to choose the higher-cost option. During her twice-monthly visits to Bland, an isolated work camp nestled between rolling, green hills, Pat Taylor now sees JPay-branded fliers warning of the misery awaiting anyone who tries to use the “free option.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On one side, a multi-ethnic lineup of models bury their faces in their hands and complain of what a “nightmare” it was to complete the money order, how it got lost or delayed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There’s a better way,” the flier promises on the reverse side, which depicts an attractive young woman seated with her laptop computer. For “Faster, Easier, Next-Day Delivery,” families can choose from a menu of high-fee options.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Tequila, cigars and lobbying</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To impress state corrections officials and gain their business, JPay spends heavily on industry conventions attended by agency heads with contracting authority. During a 2012 convention of the American Correctional Association, the company threw what it called an “END OF THE WORLD PARTY” at a Denver wine bar that bills itself as “about you, and your inalienable right to the unbridled enjoyment of food and wine.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The invitation, printed on a disposable beer coaster, promised “a bash, JPay-style: *fuerte* tequila, hand-rolled cigars, a live mariachi band.” Conventioneers could catch a JPay shuttle leaving from the hotel “ALL NIGHT LONG,” it said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For years, JPay has sponsored an <a href=# rel=noopener>award for former state corrections directors</a> presented by the Association of State Correctional Administrators, paying for the recipient’s trip and a Wexford crystal bowl inscribed with the honoree’s name.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay’s outreach extends to state legislatures as well, even though many of the company’s contracts forbid it from using fee revenue to lobby. The company has <a href=# rel=noopener>hired registered lobbyists</a> in at least seven states. Shapiro says JPay’s lawyers approved the use of company funds for that purpose.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Ohio, it tapped Thomas Needles, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush. Needles gives generously to Republican candidates and also lobbies for for-profit universities. In Maryland, JPay hired Bruce Bereano, one of the state’s best-paid lobbyists, who was disbarred after a 1994 conviction for overbilling his clients and using the money for campaign donations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The company also sought to lobby Washington for access to the federal Bureau of Prisons’ 216,000 inmates — what Shapiro has called “the mother ship of all contracts,” which is now held by Bank of America.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It spent $20,000 in 2012 to hire Park Strategies, run by former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D’Amato of New York, in an effort to obtain the contract. That effort was not successful.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>More inmates, smaller budgets</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay was founded in 2002, just as the U.S. prison population neared the apex of a three-decade climb that more than quadrupled the number of inmates in state prisons. Shortly thereafter, as the economy went into recession, state budgets were squeezed and officials looked more aggressively for ways to cut spending on prisons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Already, private vendors had stepped in with a solution: They would charge prisoners sky-high prices for phone services, snack foods, hygiene products and clothing, then return a large cut back to the prisons — often 40 percent or more.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro was the first entrepreneur to see how financial services might provide another stream of revenue. For a fee, he offered to deliver cash in ways that saved time and effort for corrections agencies, and often to give them a portion of the proceeds, just as the phone and commissary companies were doing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When we started, the states were very much saying to us, ‘There’s no need for procurement here because there’s no one else doing what you do,’ ” Shapiro said in a 2012 interview. Ten years later, he said, all of them were asking companies to submit bids for the work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That doesn’t mean the door is open to competitors. Most states, including Virginia, now contract with JPay or its main competitor under a <a href=# rel=noopener>master agreement</a> negotiated by Nevada in 2011 on behalf of a multi-state consortium. Participating states can simply sign on to the deal with one or both of the companies without the hassle of separately determining the best company for the job.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JPay is protected from other market forces, as well. When states offer its music players and tablet computers for sale to inmates, they often confiscate radios that people already own, according to inmates in Ohio. This leaves inmates dependent on JPay’s music downloads, which can cost 30 to 50 percent more than the same songs on iTunes, inmates say.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The profit-sharing arrangements are at the core of JPay’s origin story, Shapiro said in 2012. A couple of years out of college, he spent months driving around upstate New York, pitching JPay to “every sheriff, whether they had five inmates or 100 inmates” — without success.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then someone in Passaic County, New Jersey, suggested that they offer the county 10 percent of their revenue, “so the jail would be less of a tax burden on the community.” The warden signed up on the spot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Critics including Alex Friedmann, associate director of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Human Rights Defense Center</a>, an inmates’ advocacy group, says the profit-sharing amounts to a legal kickback. “They charge exhorbitant fees then kick back a percentage of their revenue. … The company doesn’t need that for profit,” Friedmann said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro says he prefers the term “commission” because “the word kickback has a negative connotation, and it seems like some person is making that money and pocketing it and buying a Chevrolet or something, when in fact it’s going to use for the benefit of inmates — basketball hoops, volleyball, whatever.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most states put their share of the cash in an “Inmate Welfare Fund” that is supposed to be used for inmate benefits beyond what is guaranteed to them by law. As incarceration rates climbed, however, the definition of “inmate benefit” drifted, says Justin Jones, who was director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections until last year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The Legislature allowed us to broaden the definition of inmate welfare and it got to the point, almost anything they would fund through appropriations could now be paid for as inmate welfare,” he says. “It ended up where we started using that money if an inmate went out to medical on an emergency and medical was end-of-year short,” he says. “We bought air conditioners, ice machines, X-ray machines.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jones was not a fan of the system. If legislatures want to impose longer prison sentences or “if they create new crimes, then the legislature should appropriate dollars for that,” he says. “I should not have to go in and redefine and stretch the definition of inmate welfare accounts.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Double dipping</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Taken together, JPay and other prison vendors create a system in which families are paying to send the money, and inmates are paying again to spend it, says Keith Miller, who is serving 21 ½ years at Bland for a series of drug-related, violent crimes committed in his early 20s. The earliest he may be released is 2021, when his mother will be 87 years old.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The fact that [my mother] has to pay the fees to send the money and then the fact that [prison agencies] make a certain cut off it seems to me that [the prisons are] double-dipping into the money they’re sending,” he said in an interview at the prison. “It really doesn’t make sense to me that this should be allowed.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro is skeptical that JPay’s fees make much of a difference for inmates’ families. He says companies that provide other services to inmates, such as phones and commissary, are the real problem.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Compared to the commissary or phone revenue, we’re just a drop in the bucket,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That may be changing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year, the Federal Communications Commission dusted off a 12-year-old petition filed by inmates’ families who argued that prison phone rates were unfairly high, preventing them from maintaining contact with loved ones. The commission <a href=# rel=noopener>capped rates</a> for many calls under its authority to ensure that pay-phone rates are just, fair and reasonable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Mignon Clyburn</a>, who was acting chairwoman of the FCC when it passed the rate cap and now serves as one of three commissioners, says the action was necessary because people are “making unspeakable sacrifices to stay in touch with their loved ones.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vincent Townsend, president of <a href=# rel=noopener>Pay-Tel Communications</a>, a major provider of phones for inmates, said his industry “abused the public.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>‘Ethical, right, moral’</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other prison vendors “better pay attention to what’s ethical, right, moral,” he said. “Because if you don’t then some regulator’s going to step in, and you’re going to have to deal with it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There is a crucial difference: The telephone industry is closely regulated by the FCC, which has explicit authority to set rates for pay-phone calls. Financial and consumer protection regulators have less power over pricing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can sue companies for offering unfair, deceptive or abusive financial services. The bureau declined more than a dozen requests to discuss specific issues related to prison financial services.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Federal Trade Commission, which has consumer-protection authority and the power to ensure that markets are competitive, declined to comment “on specific companies or conduct.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Regulators in seven states have levied fines totaling $408,500 against JPay for operating without a license. The actions were not designed to disrupt its business, according to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a trade group that represents these regulators in Washington.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“State banking regulators are concerned with ensuring that businesses operating in their states are properly licensed and with enforcing applicable laws (including consumer protection laws),” the group’s spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>‘Invent a better way’</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shapiro says he understands the challenges faced by poor families of inmates since JPay’s startup days, when he would spend “hours on the phone with a grandmother, talking about her day at Wal-Mart.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He says he feels trapped by the structure of the industry he has come to dominate. He wishes the fees were lower, that states didn’t force him to charge more and give them a share and that he could “invent a better way” than asking people’s families to help pay for their imprisonment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet Shapiro says he is satisfied to compete within what he admits is a broken system, even if the system may be punishing some innocent family members.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For many families, JPay has become that system. When Jewel Miller, 80, phoned JPay’s call center last month to ask why her payments are delayed, and why she must submit the same form every time she sends a money order to Keith, the operator hung up on her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a series of interviews it became clear that Shapiro was unaware of some of the fees related to his business. He said he did not know, for example, that Florida now charges its own fee for money order deposits after JPay processes the payments.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These fees are spelled out in JPay’s contracts with states, which Shapiro signed. Florida’s says it will charge a 50 cent “Money Order by Mail” fee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As of July, Shapiro was unaware of JPay’s own $1.95 fee to deposit money orders in Indiana, declaring, “If someone sends $100 with a money order to an Indiana inmate, that inmate gets $100. … I am positive.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Two days later, he called back to say, “We’re working with the states right now to get some of those fees taken off.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So far, the fees remain in place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Eleanor Bell </a>contributed to this story.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Watch the accompanying web documentary “Time is Money” here</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbGRrgHh%2BjpypoqWZo66tecmuqq2hk5p6sb7IrKannaKoerG%2Bzp%2BgrWc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dative-and-genitive-in-german.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dative and Genitive in German | Lingoda</a>
