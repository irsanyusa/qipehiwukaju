A lot of people will not understand that. So I don't bother to explain to people when they ask me why," she said.</p><p>"A couple of years ago I wanted to change my name when I found out that I could not really grasp the meaning of my name. Some people said it meant 'beauty' some other people said it meant 'beautiful serpent'.</p><p>"So I was cut in between not knowing what the right meaning is. Linda seemed to have diverse meaning and I wasn't quite comfortable with that. Also with the fact that Belinda was not the first name that my parents gave to me.

He came up with different names and asked us to pick."</p><p>"Funny enough I picked Melinda but I didn't like the name because people started calling me Mirinda in school. So I decided to just go on with Belinda because they could not twist it to something funny like Mirinda."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-4c06db20-665c-4bb2-94ec-bed739863be5 data-caption="The movie star also announced the name change of her brand to GCB Empire [BelindaEffah]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/RLcktkpTURBXy80NTM2YzJjOGIyNjc3NzE2OWQyNzE4M2I2MmZlYTBjMS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAbzCww></span><p>"I should have known not to pick Belinda because my brother actually picked it for my sister and I was going to be Melinda but she said she wanted Fiona.

That was because nothing seems to make sense to me anymore. Not money, not people, not material things," she explained.</p><p>"Before then, on my own I wanted to change my name but when I thought about it, and made research about name change, it was too complicated you have to change your whole identity, you have to do the paper works, of course I'm a brand people know me as Belinda Effah."</p><p>"So it's personal and my fans are very personal too. I mean they won't accept it at all cost. I actually changed it three years ago but not on papers. It was too tedious so I gave it up. However, on the15th of August last year. I had a divine encounter with God to change my name to Grace."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Nobody changed my name to Grace, God did. So after my encounter with God, I called my parents and told them not to call me Belinda anymore, and my mom said wow... congratulations. The interesting part is that my mom said she named me Grace at birth."</p><p>The movie star then announced at the event about the official change of her name.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-736fb88a-8d12-4592-99a8-8d7f02c8aeca data-caption="The actress says all her documents now go by Grace Charis Bassey Effah [BelindaEffah]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span><p>"So... Dear world, ladies and gentlemen of the press, dear family and friends I will like to be recognised and identified as Grace-Charis Bassey henceforth and not as Belinda anymore.

It's ok, I'm giving you guys six months to get use it," she said.</p><p>"I'm Grace-Charis Bassey and I want to unveil my new logo for my business. From House Of Belinda to Grace-Charis Bassey empire. So this is my representation now. A couple of people have asked me what Charis means. Charis means Grace, so I'm double dose of grace."
